# Introduction

RAGL, Season 5 is played out over 15 weeks from April 2nd through July 15th of 2018. Including one break week from May 7th-13th, 1 extra delay week from June 25th to July 1st and the two playoffs weeks (July 2nd - July 15th). During this time the players within each division will have 2 matches vs 11 opponents, playing for match-points to be added to a score table. At the end of the season the top 4 players in Masters and Minions will face off in a best of 5 playoffs. There will be a maximum of 12 players for every division. The results of the playoff series and final standings for those outside the playoffs decides who wins prizes and titles as well as promotions, qualifiers and relegation towards other divisions.

Match-ups are tacked on to weeks/rounds, in which players have to play their match-ups against a specific opponent. Official communications between the players and with league officials are primarily done through email, involving reporting results and various league business. However, a Discord is being implemented as an alternative means.
Registrations

(also see: Season 5 Registrations thread)

For Season 5, all players have until March 23rd (23:59 UTC) to register/confirm their participation. It is strongly recommended that players prioritize an active email account in order to reduce response time with messages from players or league officials.

Registration emails from new players are titled REGISTRATION and must include the following:
* Nick that will be used throughout the season.
* 3-lettered initials for tagging replays (e.g. SoScared = SOS).
* Country and timezone expressed in UTC (see http://www.timeanddate.com)

Players transferring over from a previous season don't have to provide any other information than the expressed confirmation. Recurring players simply register with an email titled CONFIRMATION.

Recurring players are seeded per guidelines provided by the previous season results. Players who feel like they've found themselves in a division above their skill level may request to be dropped a division lower to better accommodate them. If the league officials can find another player who's ability more closely matches that division in skill, that player will be granted a promotion into that league. New players will be evaluated by league officials and placed in a division that best matches their skill, based of availability of the divisions.

# Emails: Contact & Match Scheduling

All participating players are themselves responsible for their weekly matches. Players have provided active email addresses as a means of guaranteed contact availability and email correspondence is the official recognized means of which players schedule their match-ups, report delays, disputes and failed contact. However, at the discretion of the players, any venue of contact can be used as long as you recognize that league officials will be of limited help should things go awry. League officials cannot guarantee or take responsibility for information processed outside email correspondences. Email lists are provided to all players within their respective divisions by Monday, April 2nd. Email lists are not publicized beyond the division.

As a general tip, be first out early on with a simple 'Hello' and provide information to when it suits you best to play. Initiate contact at the start of the week/round (Monday), or perhaps even the day before.

# Emails: Delay Notices

The unforeseen will happen and so you might as well learn this procedure well (as with 'Emails: Failed Contact' below). In the event you need to delay a match-up for any reason you will have to send a delay notice per email (titled DELAY) to both your opponent and the league officials. The player doesn't need to give up a reason for the delay. The reasons for the delay are not publicized should the player wish to give one. The delay notice will be available on the forum's RA:GL Scoreboard thread until the delayed match-ups have been played.

New in season 5: delay notices will delay matches automatically to the nearest delay round. This way players who cannot find team to play each week are no longer required to resubmit a delay notice every week. Please note however, that the delay notice does expire at the end of the delay round. This means players will then need to resubmit the delay notice if they were not able to play their games!

The delay notice must include at minimum:
* The week/round and match-up that is delayed.

Further:
* Delay notices must be sent no later than the next week's Monday at 14:00/2:00PM UTC.
* Players can have up to 3 delay notices running simultaneously.

Worth noting, the league has no rules regarding matches being played before their designated rounds. If you foresee some scheduled conflict there's nothing to stop you from attempting getting some match-ups done earlier.

# Emails: Failed Contact

An opponent may fail to respond or contact properly during a week/round. The moment you suspect your match-up may be in jeopardy you should send a 'Failed Contact' notice per email (titled FAILED CONTACT) as soon as possible. This notice is overridden immediately if you follow up later that same week with a Result Report or a Delay Notice. The 'Failed Contact' notice also protects you from unfair penalties granted by league officials due to unreported matches. If, for whatever reason, a failed contact notice is sent by both players before the end of the week/round, the event is converted into a delay notice, delaying their match-up to the nearest delay round.

Any unreported matches without a Delay or Failed Contact notice are rewarded with a strike. 3 strikes results in a Season Forfeit.

For further information of strikes please see: League tables: Placements and tie-breakers

# Promotions/demotions

Due to the nature of the league, promotions often can't be defined until the exact set up is figured out. However, the general idea is something like this:
The top players in Minions, Recruits, and (Cadets) will be promoted to the next division. The bottom players in each division will be regulated to one below. Additionally, There will once again be a path to the hidden masters, allowing a player who's skill that far surpasses other to challenge their way up the division into the very top
The exact path of the hidden master will also depend on how many sign ups and the exact structure of the divisions.

# Season Forfeit

There's no reason having to be disgracefully booted out of the league just because you find yourself unable to fulfill your obligations.

Season Forfeit is sent per email (titled SEASON FORFEIT) in order to forfeit the current season, immediately placing you last in your division. Naturally you'll be relegated down one division and will be able to participate next season from that particular division.

# Waiting List

The RAGL waiting list is a measure to ensure each recruit/cadet division is filled as much as possible. Should a season start and a player strike out (not show up for their first three games) Or a player forfeit the season that player will be dropped and the first in line on the wait list will replace that player. For future seasons the wait list will be made up of players who are last to sign up during registration after divisions have been filled.

# Disconnects during a match

Players decide between themselves the outcome of a disconnected game. If the players cannot come to an agreement, they will have to submit the replay to the official (titled DISCONNECT) for evaluation. The evaluation will likely demand a rematch unless the match is undoubtedly decided towards one player. The final word will be up the the official evaluating regardless. Players who disconnects more than 3 times during a season will forfeit the match points of their remaining disconnected matches regardless of the state of the ongoing match.

# Disputes

Disputes are sent per email (titled DISPUTE or CORRECTION) to a league official in the event it is believed the officials has handled a situation incorrectly or has recorded erroneous information. The league officials reserves the right to make the final call in disputed situations with the health of the league in mind.

# Game setup

New in season 5: players will not longer have guest or away matches, rather just 2 matches against the opponent of the week (best of 2).
Players ranked higher during the season are to 'host' the map first. The second player will then pick their faction. Players are allowed their own discretion in following this rule. In the event of two players being equal in the standings players are again encouraged to use their discretion in who picks a map/faction first. For the second game in the series, the role will be reversed.

The standard game settings in the game lobby should be familiar to all players. These will be used consistently across all divisions:
* Explored Map: On
* Short Game : On
* Fog of War : On
* Crates : Off
* Debug Menu : Off
* Starting Cash : $5000
* Tech Level : Unrestricted
* Starting Units : MCV Only
* Game Speed : Normal
* Player spots must be random.

The league will by default always run on the latest release. In the event a new release is shipped during an ongoing season, both releases are acceptable for that given week/round of the new release date. Using Playtest is allowed at the discretion of the players. Exploiting bugs during a match on a playtest disqualifies the match played. Both players in a match will have to agree if a playtest is to be used.

## Playoffs/Tie-breaker Game Setup

Playoffs and tie-breakers will use the same game settings as above, with the exception that the first map shall be randomly chosen.

# Playoff Format

Exact Path of the Hidden Master will be explained in detail once divisions are finalized.
New to season 5: PotHM will be shortened to best of 3 instead of best of 5.
For this 2 Minions divisions, the 1st place players will face off against each other for the prizes. The second place players will face off for the final promotional spot to masters and the 2nd leg of PotHM.
For Masters, the top 4 will face off, 1 seed playing 4, 2 playing 3, and then winners will play for 1st and 2nd, while the losers play for 3rd and 4th.

# League tables: Placements and tie-breakers

Players are ranked within each division based on match points. In the event of tied points at the end of the season, the players will be ranked against each other based on:
1. Result from the players' current seasons' match-up.
2. 1 game rematch

Meaning the match-up between players will primarily decide the ranking. In the event this match-up went 1-1 (or the match failed to report) then a 1 game rematch will be required. In the event of multiple ties a best of 1 round robin may be required.

Strikes can be given out for a a number of different reasons, failure to report a match, cheating, etc. 3 strikes results in a Season Forfeit.
Global strikes are a record of strikes carried over from all seasons, starting with season 4. Basically they are just a record to keep track of any trouble makers. At the end of each season player will lose a strike accrued against them thus allowing good behavior to be shown.

# Map pool for Season 5

All maps used in RAGL, Season 5 are custom maps. Currently 8 maps have been selected. Additional maps may be put to a vote to round out the pool at 10. The Map pool be finalized On the 31st of March.
The maps are:
* Pitfight
* Racetracks
* Trapped
* River of gold
* Faceoff
* Shadow Fiend II
* Badger Hills
* Stantisa

Additionally 2 other maps will be put to a vote by the players for the final 2 spots in the map pool. Current maps being considered are:
* Baphomet
* Ragnarok
* Blobomaly
* Teared Strait
* Hesperian Grove
* Roadkings 2
* The Great divide

If you have other maps you wish to opine for addition into the pool please just let us know.

# Replay files: Renaming and Uploading

Replay files are the sole documentation of the matches played and thus should be treated with great care. The host player bears the responsibility to have the file uploaded. Upon agreement the guest player or spectator can upload the replay file.

The replay files will have to be renamed specifically before uploading. In your folder or your replay viewer, delete the ENTIRE filename and replace it with:

RAGL-S04-[MASTER/MINIONA/MINIONB/RECRUITA/RECRUITB/RECRUITC]-RXX-[player initials]-[other player initials]-[G1,G2], all letters in CAPS.

S04 stands for Season 4, RXX stands for Round and then XX a round number (01, 02, 03 etc.).

Example: In Season 1, SoScared played 2 matches against PersianImmortal, and the players agreed for SoScared to upload them both. They both play in the Minions' A Division. The matches was played on 25th of April 2016 which, according to the schedule table, coincides with 'Round 04'. The players' given initials are SOS for SoScared and PSI for PersianImmortal. The replay files for these matches would be:

SoScared's match: RAGL-S01-MINIONA-R04-SOS-PSI-G1

PersianImmortal's match: RAGL-S01-MINIONA-R04-SOS-PSI-G2

Replay files not properly renamed will not be accepted. We understand that naming and uploading replays are a pain and are still looking into a nice and function automated system. In the mean time we will be cracking down on improperly named replays.

All replays are uploaded to Jazz_KCS's file server: http://64hdb.mine.nu:5534/mIRROR/ora_replays/RAGL_Season_five/ In the correct Round and Division sub-folder, click the 'Upload files' link on the right side of the page. You'll have to rename the replay file before uploading. If the replay is uploaded erroneously, re-upload the correct file and notify the tournament official so that the wrong file can be removed.

# Emails: Reporting Results

After the replay files are uploaded the results are reported per email (titled RESULTS). The report needs to include who won the matches. As with replay files the host player is ultimately responsible for reporting the results but practically it is sufficient for one of the players in a match-up to report the results. The results can be shared with a league official through any means but as stated earlier, league officials cannot guarantee a fair count of your match points without the Result Report by email.

# Streaming and casting

The Red Alert Global League has a stream channel dedicated to RAGL streams and can be utilized by verified streamers. However, streamers of the event will need to add a minimum of 3 minute delay to their streams when covering an official Live league match. For this season in particular, the league will attempt to highlight a match up each week to be streamed.

# Prize Pool contributions

For those interested, a personal email account, OpenRA.RAGL@Gmail.com is connected via PayPal to host the prize pool contributions. Just send a payment through PayPal to that email address via PayPal and in the 'Write a note' section either write your playername/name or state if you wish to remain anonymous given that all individual contributions will be listed in this post under 'Current Prize Pool'. Further you can add a request as to how you would want your contribution to be paid to the league positions specifically (including all divisions). By default the prizepool will be split among the divisions (roughly estimated) ~70% Master's Division (top 4), ~20% Minions' Division (top 2). The last ~10% will be used for various prized announced at another time. PayPal contributions are converted into Dollars ($), if you send money in your local currency the prizepool host will cover the conversion fees. Future seasons may convert the prizepool in Euros (€).

*Prizepools are completely voluntary and are not expected to be significant each season. IF the prize pool for a particular season is thin the exact spread and rewards will be carefully considered. (No one wants to win 5 cents as a random prize!) Eventually it would be nice to create a surplus so that each season has a minimum prizepool. However, for season 4 no such thing has been implemented.
