# Introduction

The Season 2 of RAGL will be played out over 12 weeks, including a break week, from September 5th through November 27th. During this time the players will have 11 match-ups in their respective divisions, playing for match-points to be added to a score table. 1 match-up consists of 2 games against an opponent, 1 host and 1 guest match in which the host picks the map from a set map pool (see below). There will be a maximum of 12 players for every division. At the end of the season the tables will decide whether a player wins a prize, a title, promote or relegate to other divisions or have to play qualification matches.

Match-ups are scheduled on a weekly basis, meaning players have up until any given week to play their match-ups unless league officials are notified about delays or players' abscense before the end of the match week. Official communications between players themselves and with league officials will go through players' registered email accounts and with an official email account openra.ragl@gmail.com.

# Registrations

New players and players from the previous season have until August 31st (23:59 UTC) to register or confirm their participation in Season 2. This is done by sending an email titled REGISTRATION or CONFIRMATION to openra.ragl@gmail.com. It is strongly recommended the player use an active email account in order to more easily intercept messages from other players or officials.

All registrations must include:
* Nickname that will be used throughout the season
* 3-lettered initials for tagging replays, if not registered already (e.g. SoScared = SOS)
* Country and timezone expressed in UTC (see http://www.timeanddate.com)
* Faction pick (including random) for Season 2 (Masters' Division players only)

Players confirmed from Season 1 are placed in the division to which they promoted, qualified or relegated to, unless players in a higher placement forfeits their position inherited from season 1. New registrations are placed in available spots on a first-come, first served basis.

Division tables and fixtures for Season 2 are publicised September 1st.

# Emails: Player Contacts

Monday, September 5th marks the first day of the first Round/Week of Season 2. For every week, players will have their match-up played and reported no later than the next Monday at 14:00/2:00PM UTC, unless the match-up is announced delayed in before the same deadline. Players are free to play their matches before their scheduled weekly match-ups.

All participating players are themselves responsible for their weekly matches. Players provide an active email address as a means of guaranteed contact and availability towards the other players. Email contacts are recognized as the official means in which players make contact to find a time to play, report results to officials, announce delays and report failed contacts. Other venues of contact can be used (e.g. IRC, Skype etc.) however, when it comes to documentation and handling of disputes, delays, failed contact etc, the official email correspondance is the only recognized venue, meaning officials cannot guarantee or take responsibility for information processed outside email correspondances. Email lists are sent to all players in their respective divisions from a league official on September 1st. Email lists are not publicised.

At minimum, players ought to send an initial email (titled MATCH) no later than Tuesdays 23:59 UTC for each round to the opposing player. Failing to do so grants the opponent an automatic immunity from strikes and forfeitted points, meaning the match is played at the opponent's leisure if he/she desires to have the match played at all. In the event both players fail to send an initial email, no such penalty remains in effect.

# Emails: Delay Notices

Something unforseen may happen, you might have planned trips, you might need a short break, etc. In the event you need to delay a match-up for any given week you may send a delay notice per email (titled DELAY) to both the opponent and the league officials.
The delay notice must include:
* The round number and match-up that needs to be delayed
* To which round you need to delay it to

Further:
* Delay notices must be sent no later than the next week's Monday at 14:00/2:00PM UTC.
* Players can have up to 3 delay notices running simoultaneously.
* Matches can be delayed up until 2 weeks past the final round of the season.

The delay notice will be available on the forum's RA:GL Scoreboard thread until the delayed match-ups has been played. The player don't need to give up a reason for the delay. The reasons for the delay are not publicised should the player wish to give one.

# Emails: Failed Contact

If an opponent fails to make contact or properly respond during a match-up's dedicated round or a delayed match round, the player needs to send the league officials a failed contact notice per email (titled FAILED CONTACT) and give a short reasoning for the notice. The player is then granted the round's match-up points should the absent player not respond within that week (no later than the next week's Monday at 14:00/2:00PM UTC). If, for whatever reason, a failed contact notice is sent by both players before the end of the week, the event is converted into a delay notice, moving their match-up over to the next round.

Failure to play matches without proper delay or failed contact notices results in a strike. 3 strikes earns a player a league forfeit.

# Season and League Forfeits

There's no reason having to disgracefully be booted out of the league just because you found out you're unable to participate. There are two ways to do this:

Season Forfeit is sent per email to the league officials (titled SEASON FORFEIT) in order to forfeit the current season and thus place you last in your division. Once the season is completed you'll be relegated down one division and will be able to participate next season from that particular division.

League Forfeit is sent per email to the league officials (titled LEAGUE FORFEIT) in order to quit the league. You'll be placed last in your division and relegated throughout all active divisions (bottom out) once the current season is completed.

You do not need to give up a reason for season and league forfeits.

# Disconnects during a match

Players decide between themselves the outcome with a disconnected game. If the players cannot come to an agreement, they will have to submit the replay to the official (titled DISCONNECT) for evaluation. The evaluation will likely demand a rematch unless the match is undoubtedly decided towards one player. The final word will be up the the official evaluating regardless. Players who disconnects more than 3 times during a season will forfeit the match point of their remaining disconnected matches.

# Disputes

Disputes are sent per email (titled DISPUTE or CORRECTION) to a league official in the event it is believed the officials has handled a situation incorrectly or has recorded erroneous information. The league officials reserves the right to make the final call in disputed situations with the health of the league in mind.

# Game settings

As mentioned initially, all players will play a 'host' and a 'guest' match against their opponents. The host player simply picks the map. Both host and guest matches counts towards 1 point.

The standard game settings in the game lobby should be familiar to all players. These will be used consistently across all divisions with a few exceptions:
* Masters' League participants are required to pick 1 faction for the duration of the tournament. This also includes random Allies/Soviet or 'Any'.
Also,
* Master's Division, Explored Map: Off
* Minion's Division and divisions below, Explored Map: On

The rest of the settings goes as follows:
* Short Game : On
* Fog of War : On
* Crates : Off
* Debug Menu : Off :)
* Starting Cash : $5000
* Tech Level : Unrestricted
* Starting Units : MCV Only
* Game Speed : Normal/Faster

Player spots has to be random.


The league will always run on the latest release, with exception to the week in which a new release is available in which the league will accept replays from both the new and the previous release.

# League tables: Placements and tie-breakers

Players are ranked within each division based on match points. In the event of tied points at the end of the season, the players will be ranked against each other based on:
1. Result from the players' current seasons' match-up.
2. Highest guest points.
3. Rematch best-of-3

Meaning the match-up between the players that are tied will primarily decide the rank. In the event this match-up went 1-1 (or the match was striked) the secondary tie breaker is the higher guest points. In the event that the primary and secondary tie-breaker don't break the tie the player are set to play a Best-of-3 post-season to determine the placements.

# Map pool for Season 2

Custom maps (4) has to be downloaded. These custom maps will be part of the next OpenRA release.
* Behind The Veil (official map)
* Crossfire (custom map) - RAGL S02 revised: http://resource.openra.net/maps/15745/
* Desert Rats (custom map) - RAGL S02 revised: http://resource.openra.net/maps/16088/
* Dual Cold Front (custom map) RAGL S02 revised: http://resource.openra.net/maps/16089/
* Keep Off The Grass 2 (official map)
* Northwest Passage (official map)
* Ore Lord (official map)
* Sidestep (official map)
* Singles (official map)
* Tournament Island (official map)
* Warwind (custom map) - RAGL S02 revised: http://resource.openra.net/maps/16087/
* Winter Storm (official map)

As mentioned under 'Game Settings', players spots must be random. This includes 4 player maps Crossroads and Tournament Island.

Using different revisions of maps listed above doesn't automatically disqualify but might have to be re played (delayed) if the revision is unreasonably different and/or if the players cannot link the specific revised map upon request.

The map pool is up for changes until August 28th.

# Replay files: Renaming and Uploading

Replay files are the sole documentation of the matches played and thus should be treated with great care. The host player bears the responsibility to have the file uploaded. Upon agreement the guest player or spectator can upload the replay file.

The replay files will have to be renamed specifically before uploading. In your folder or your replay viewer, delete the ENTIRE filename and replace it with:

RAGL-S02-[MASTER/MINION/RECRUIT]-RXX-[host initials]-[guest initials], all letters in CAPS.

S02 stands for Season 2, RXX stands for Round and then XX a round number (01, 02, 03 etc.).

Example: In Season 1, SoScared played a host and guest match against PersianImmortal, and the players agreed for SoScared to upload them both. They both play in the Minions' Division. The matches was played on 25th of April 2016 which, according to the schedule table, coincides with 'Round 04'. The players' given initials are SOS for SoScared and PSI for PersianImmortal. The replay files for these matches would be:

SoScared's host match: RAGL-S01-MINION-R04-SOS-PSI

PersianImmortal's host match: RAGL-S01-MINION-R04-PSI-SOS

Replay files not properly renamed will not be accepted.

All replays are uploaded to Jazz_KCS's file server: [http://64h.mine.nu:5534/mIRROR/ora_repl ... eason_Two/](http://64h.mine.nu:5534/mIRROR/ora_replays/RAGL_Season_Two/) In the correct Round and Division subfolder, click the 'Upload files' link on the right side of the page. You'll have to rename the replay file before uploading. If the replay is uploaded erroneously, reupload the correct file and notify the tournament official so that the wrong file can be removed.

# Emails: Reporting Results

After the replay files are uploaded the results are reported per email (titled RESULTS) to the league official. The report needs to include who won the host/guest matches. As with replay files the host player is ultimately resposible for reporting the results but practically it is sufficient for one of the players in a match-up to report the results.

# Streaming and casting

The Red Alert Global League is not affiliated with any streams or vod channels. This means that anyone that wishes it should feel free to stream and cast players' matches as they see fit. However, streamers of the event will need to add a minimum of 4 minute delay to their streams when covering an official Live league match.

# Prize Pool contributions

For those interested, a personal email account SoScared123@Gmail.com is connected via PayPal to host the prize pool contributions. Just send a payment through PayPal to that email address via PayPal and in the 'Write a note' section either write your playername/name or state if you wish to remain anonymous given that all individual contributions will be listed in this post under 'Current Prize Pool'. Further you can add a request as to how you would want your contribution to be paid to the league positions specifically (including all divisions). By default the prizepool will be split among the divisions (roughly estimated) 75% Master's Division (top 3), 25% Minions' Division (top 2). PayPal contributions are converted into Dollars ($), if you send money in your local currency the prizepool host will cover the conversion fees. Future seasons will likely convert the prizepool in Euros (â‚¬).

In this season you can also donate Kel which is a forum currency on Sleipnir's Stuff to which you can shop for some features such as the Quick Reply, Custom Avatar, Signature etc. Kel donated to 'SoScared' are added to a Kel prizepool that will be awarded to the Season 2 division winners.
