# Introduction

RAGL, Season 3 is played out over 13 weeks, including two break weeks, from March 6th through June 4th of 2017. During this time the players within each division will have 2 matches vs 11 opponents, playing for match-points to be added to a score table. There will be a maximum of 12 players for every division. The score tables decides who wins prizes and titles as well as promotions, qualifiers and relegation towards other divisions.

Match-ups are tacked on to weeks/rounds, in which players have to play their match-ups against a specific opponent. Official communications between the players and with league officials are primarily done through email, involving reporting results and various league business.

# Registrations (also see: Season 3 Registrations thread)

For Season 3, all players have until February 28th (23:59 UTC) to register/confirm their participation. It is strongly recommended that players prioritize an active email account in order to reduce response time with messages from players or league officials.

Registration emails from new players are titled REGISTRATION and must include the following:
* Nick that will be used throughout the season.
* 3-lettered initials for tagging replays (e.g. SoScared = SOS).
* Country and timezone expressed in UTC (see http://www.timeanddate.com)

Players transferring over from a previous season don't have to provide any other information than the expressed confirmation, with exception of Masters' players who will have to give up a faction pick that will be used throughout the season. Recurring players simply register with an email titled CONFIRMATION.

Recurring players are seeded per guidelines provided by the previous season results. New players are placed in available spots on a first-come, first served basis.

# Emails: Contact & Match Scheduling

All participating players are themselves responsible for their weekly matches. Players have provided active email addresses as a means of guaranteed contact availability and email correspondence is the official recognized means of which players schedule their match-ups, report delays, disputes and failed contact. However, at the discretion of the players, any venue of contact can be used as long as you recognize that league officials will be of limited help should things go awry. League officials cannot guarantee or take responsibility for information processed outside email correspondences. Email lists are provided to all players within their respective divisions by Saturday, March 4th. Email lists are not publicized beyond the division.

As a general tip, be first out early on with a simple 'Hello' and provide information to when it suits you best to play. Initiate contact at the start of the week/round (Monday), or perhaps even the day before.

# Emails: Delay Notices

The unforeseen will happen and so you might as well learn this procedure well (as with 'Emails: Failed Contact' below). In the event you need to delay a match-up for any reason you will have to send a delay notice per email (titled DELAY) to both your opponent and the league officials. The player don't need to give up a reason for the delay. The reasons for the delay are not publicized should the player wish to give one. The delay notice will be available on the forum's RA:GL Scoreboard thread until the delayed match-ups has been played.
The delay notice must include at minimum:
* The week/round and match-up that is delayed.
* To which week/round you need to delay it to
Further:
* Delay notices must be sent no later than the next week's Monday at 14:00/2:00PM UTC.
* Players can have up to 3 delay notices running simultaneously.
* Matches can be delayed up until 1 week past the final round of the season.

Worth noting, the league has no rules regarding matches being played before their designated rounds. If you foresee some scheduled conflict there's nothing to stop you from attempting getting some match-ups done earlier.

# Emails: Failed Contact

An opponent may fail to respond or properly during a week/round. The moment you suspect your match-up may be in jeopardy you should send a 'Failed Contact' notice per email (titled FAILED CONTACT) as soon as possible. This notice is overridden immediately if you follow up later that same week with a Result Report or a Delay Notice. The 'Failed Contact' notice also protects you from unfair penalties granted by league officials due to unreported matches. If, for whatever reason, a failed contact notice is sent by both players before the end of the week/round, the event is converted into a delay notice, delaying their match-up by +1 week/round.

An unreported matches without a Delay or Failed Contact notice are rewarded with a strike. 3 strikes results in a League Forfeit.

# Season and League Forfeits

There's no reason having to be disgracefully booted out of the league just because you find yourself unable to fulfill your obligations. There are two ways of doing this:

Season Forfeit is sent per email (titled SEASON FORFEIT) in order to forfeit the current season, immediately placing you last in your division. Naturally you'll be relegated down one division and will be able to participate next season from that particular division.

League Forfeit is sent per email (titled LEAGUE FORFEIT) in order to quit the league altogether. You'll be placed last in your division and simply "bottom out" once the current season is completed.

You do not need to give up a reason for Season or League Forfeits.

# Disconnects during a match

Players decide between themselves the outcome of a disconnected game. If the players cannot come to an agreement, they will have to submit the replay to the official (titled DISCONNECT) for evaluation. The evaluation will likely demand a rematch unless the match is undoubtedly decided towards one player. The final word will be up the the official evaluating regardless. Players who disconnects more than 3 times during a season will forfeit the match points of their remaining disconnected matches regardless of the state of the ongoing match.

# Disputes

Disputes are sent per email (titled DISPUTE or CORRECTION) to a league official in the event it is believed the officials has handled a situation incorrectly or has recorded erroneous information. The league officials reserves the right to make the final call in disputed situations with the health of the league in mind.

# Game settings

All players will play a 'host' and a 'guest' match every week/round against an opponent. The host player simply picks the map. Both host and guest matches counts towards 1 point.
The standard game settings in the game lobby should be familiar to all players. These will be used consistently across all divisions with one exception:
Masters' League participants are required to pick 1 faction for the duration of the tournament. This also includes random Allies/Soviet or 'Any'.
The rest of the settings goes as follows:
* Explored Map: On
* Short Game : On
* Fog of War : On
* Crates [tab] : Off
* Debug Menu : Off
* Starting Cash : $5000
* Tech Level : Unrestricted
* Starting Units : MCV Only
* Game Speed : Normal

Player spots has to be random.

The league will by default always run on the latest release. In the event a new release is shipped during an ongoing season, both releases are acceptable for that given week/round of the new release date. Using Playtest is allowed at the discretion of the players. Exploiting bugs during a match on a playtest disqualifies the match played. Both players in a match will have to agree if a playtest is to be used.

# League tables: Placements and tie-breakers

Players are ranked within each division based on match points. In the event of tied points at the end of the season, the players will be ranked against each other based on:
1. Result from the players' current seasons' match-up.
2. Highest guest points.
3. Rematch best-of-3

Meaning the match-up between players will primarily decide the ranking. In the event this match-up went 1-1 (or the match failed to report) the secondary tie breaker is the higher guest points. In the event that the primary and secondary tie-breaker don't break the tie the player are set to play a Best-of-3 post-season to determine the placements.

# Map pool for Season 3

All maps used in RAGL, Season 3 are custom maps including a few balance changes prepared towards the official development branch. The balance changes involves the def. structure costs, Barracks and A.Tech Center HP and MCV build time (see changelog: https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/C ... #red-alert). Full map pack (.zip): https://www.dropbox.com/s/outh454h1cbz0 ... k.zip?dl=0

* Desert Rats (revised)
* Green Belt
* Keep off The Grass 2
* Northwest Passage (revised)
* Patches

Map revisions (deviating from more widely distributed versions) are described on the resource center (linked).

# Replay files: Renaming and Uploading

Replay files are the sole documentation of the matches played and thus should be treated with great care. The host player bears the responsibility to have the file uploaded. Upon agreement the guest player or spectator can upload the replay file.

The replay files will have to be renamed specifically before uploading. In your folder or your replay viewer, delete the ENTIRE filename and replace it with:

RAGL-S03-[MASTER/MINION/RECRUIT]-RXX-[host initials]-[guest initials], all letters in CAPS.

S03 stands for Season 3, RXX stands for Round and then XX a round number (01, 02, 03 etc.).

Example: In Season 1, SoScared played a host and guest match against PersianImmortal, and the players agreed for SoScared to upload them both. They both play in the Minions' Division. The matches was played on 25th of April 2016 which, according to the schedule table, coincides with 'Round 04'. The players' given initials are SOS for SoScared and PSI for PersianImmortal. The replay files for these matches would be:

SoScared's host match: RAGL-S01-MINION-R04-SOS-PSI

PersianImmortal's host match: RAGL-S01-MINION-R04-PSI-SOS

Replay files not properly renamed will not be accepted.

All replays are uploaded to Jazz_KCS's file server: http://64hdb.mine.nu:5534/mIRROR/ora_re ... son_Three/ In the correct Round and Division sub-folder, click the 'Upload files' link on the right side of the page. You'll have to rename the replay file before uploading. If the replay is uploaded erroneously, re-upload the correct file and notify the tournament official so that the wrong file can be removed.

# Emails: Reporting Results

After the replay files are uploaded the results are reported per email (titled RESULTS). The report needs to include who won the host and guest matches. As with replay files the host player is ultimately responsible for reporting the results but practically it is sufficient for one of the players in a match-up to report the results. The results can be shared with a league official through any means but as stated earlier, league officials cannot guarantee a fair count of your match points without the Result Report by email.

# Streaming and casting

The Red Alert Global League is not affiliated with any streams or vod channels. This means that anyone that wishes it should feel free to stream and cast players' matches as they see fit. However, streamers of the event will need to add a minimum of 3 minute delay to their streams when covering an official Live league match.

# Prize Pool contributions

For those interested, a personal email account SoScared123@Gmail.com is connected via PayPal to host the prize pool contributions. Just send a payment through PayPal to that email address via PayPal and in the 'Write a note' section either write your playername/name or state if you wish to remain anonymous given that all individual contributions will be listed in this post under 'Current Prize Pool'. Further you can add a request as to how you would want your contribution to be paid to the league positions specifically (including all divisions). By default the prizepool will be split among the divisions (roughly estimated) 75% Master's Division (top 3), 25% Minions' Division (top 2). PayPal contributions are converted into Dollars ($), if you send money in your local currency the prizepool host will cover the conversion fees. Future seasons may convert the prizepool in Euros (â‚¬).

In this season you can also donate Kel which is a forum currency on Sleipnir's Stuff to which you can shop for some features such as the Quick Reply, Custom Avatar, Signature etc. Kel donated to 'SoScared' are added to a Kel prizepool that will be awarded to all the Season 3 division winners.
